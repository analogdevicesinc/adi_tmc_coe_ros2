## Software Architecture
![Software Architecture Diagram](./doc/images/adi_tmc_coe_core_Software_Architecture_Diagram.png)

## Software Dependencies
Assumptions before building this package:
* Installed ROS Humble. If not, follow these [steps](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).
* Setup workspace (with workspace folder named as "ros2_ws"). If not, follow these [steps](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html).

# Clone

In the website:
1. Make sure that the branch dropdown is set to "humble".
2. Click the "Clone" or "Code" button, then copy the SSH or HTTPS link (eg, "*.git").

In a terminal, do the following:
```bash
$ cd ~/ros2_ws/src
$ git clone <copied SSH o HTTPS link here> adi_tmc_coe #clones repo to "adi_tmc_coe" directory name
```
# Build

Do proper exports first:
```bash
# $ source /opt/ros/<ROS version>/setup.bash
$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```
Where:
- "ROS version" is the user's actual ROS version

Then, install all required dependencies (See [SoftwareDependencies](#software-dependencies)) using rosdep:
```bash
$ cd ~/ros2_ws
$ rosdep init
$ rosdep update
$ rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src
```
Then:
```bash
$ cd ~/ros2_ws
$ colcon build
## To clean first before building, you may run the following instead:
## $ colcon build --cmake-clean-first
```
> :memo: _Note: It is recommended that 1 terminal is dedicated to building the package/workspace to avoid complex issues as mentioned in [ROS2 Source the overlay](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html#source-the-overlay)_

# Pre-Launch (One-time per setup)

Not all Trinamic modules are on TMCL_IDE specially CoE due to different interface used. Check module first for other communication protocol than CoE (UART, USB or CAN). Proceed to next steps if module is available in TMCL_IDE.

> :memo: _Note: Different communication protocol might need different cable to communicate with TMCL_IDE (e.g. UART - USB to TTL adapter, USB - TypeC/TypeB/Micro, CAN - PCAN-USB adapter)._
>

If it's the first time to use the set of motors for the TMC, it is required to calibrate and tune the PID settings of the motors first.

Do the calibrations/tuning by downloading and using [TMCL-IDE](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/evaluation-hardware-and-software/motor-motion-control-software/tmcl-ide.html).

## BLDC Motors

### Calibrate the motors

For a run-through/tutorial of how the calibration is done in the TMCL-IDE via its `Wizard Pool` feature, check this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MASVD_2tNuo).

### Tune the PI settings of the motors

For a run-through/tutorial of how the PI tuning is done in the TMCL-IDE via its `PI Tuning` feature, check this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfZAs-QdYlQ).

> :memo: _Note: For all the calibration and tuning done, store all the parameters set from TMCL_IDE on the board's EEPROM. Do this by doing any of the following:_
> - _Clicking the "Store Parameter" under Settings of each axis_
> - _Using STAP (Store Axis Parameters) command from Direct Mode_
> - _Creating and uploading a TMCL Program, and enabling the "auto start mode" under SGP (Set Global Parameter) command from Direct Mode_
> - - :memo: _Note: Some boards don't have "auto start mode", so in such a case, use the other options to store the parameters._

## Stepper Motors

### Calibrate the motors

For a run-through/tutorial of how the calibration is done in the TMCL-IDE via its `Wizard Pool` feature, check this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6r63Q7Yr58o).

## Pre-Launch (One-time)

The [ethercat_grant](#ethercat_grant) node/utility is needed to run the [tmc_coe_ros2_node](#tmc_coe_ros2_node) without root privileges.

If built from source, you will need to go through [ethercat_grant/Installation](#installation).

## Config/Launch File

Before launching the package, make sure that the *interface_name* on the yaml file is correct. Modify the corresponding yaml file depending on your setup:

* If using 1 slave with 1 axis, modify 1slave_1axis.yaml,
* If using 2 slaves with 1 axis per slave, modify 2slaves_1axis_per_slave.yaml,
* If using 2 slaves with 2 axes per slave, modify 2slaves_2axes_per_slave.yaml,

Modify *interface_name* (check [Parameter](#parameters)) and set the interface name of your adapter.

To check the interface name, run this command in terminal:
```bash
$ ifconfig
```

Interface name is usually starts with enx / eth. Copy and paste the interface name on the *interface_name* in yaml file.

Also, check the launch file if correct trinamic board autogenerated yaml and config yaml is loaded. TMCM-1461 setup is the default namespace for 1slave_1axis and 2slaves_1axis_per_slave launch files, provide the correct namespace if other device is used.

# Launch
This package has 3 sample launch files for:

single slave with single axis (used module is TMCM-1461-CoE)
```bash
$ ros2 launch adi_tmc_coe_core 1slave_1axis.launch
```
2 slaves with single axis on both slaves (used module is 2x TMCM-1461-CoE)
```bash
$ ros2 launch adi_tmc_coe_core 2slaves_1axis_per_slave.launch
```
2 slaves with 2 axes on both slaves
```bash
$ ros2 launch adi_tmc_coe_core 2slaves_2axes_per_slave.launch
```

## ethercat_grant
adi_ethercat_grant_node is a ROS2 node for ethercat_grant. Theoretically, if this package is available via binary installation, there should be no further instructions required.

### Installation

If this package is installed via source, before running the launch file, do the steps below:
1. Open /scripts directory
2. Make script executable
```$ chmod +x ethercat_grant_installation.sh```
3. Run the script with sudo
```$ sudo ./ethercat_grant_installation.sh```
4. Run the launch file

# Quick Tests

## Test Velocity Mode

To do a quick test of Velocity Mode, there is a fake velocity script that the user can run.
Idea is, this script will send Velocity commands (as a ROS topic), then the first motor should be expected to:
1. Increase velocity every 3secs, clockwise (in m/s: 3, 6, 9)
2. Stop for 5secs
3. Increase velocity every 3secs, counter-clockwise (in m/s: -3, -6, -9)
4. Stop for 5secs

To proceed with the test, execute these following commands on three (3) different terminals (in sequence):
> :memo: _Note: Assuming that the package was [built](#build) in Terminal 1._

| Terminal 2 | Terminal 3  | Terminal 4 |
--- | --- | ---|
|<pre>`$ cd ~/ros2_ws/` <br>`$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash` <br>`$ source install/setup.bash` <br>`$ ros2 launch adi_tmc_coe_core 1slave_1axis.launch.py`  | <pre>`$ cd ~/ros2_ws/` <br>`$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash` <br>`$ source install/setup.bash` <br>`$ ros2 topic echo /tmc_info_1_0` | <pre>`$ cd ~/ros2_ws/src/adi_tmc_coe/adi_tmc_coe_core/scripts` <br>`$ sudo chmod 777 fake_cmd_vel.sh` <br>`$ ./fake_cmd_vel.sh` |

**Monitor the velocity of the first motor (watch out for velocity value at Terminal 3).**

> :memo: _Notes:_
> - _Terminals 3 and 4 are best viewed side-by-side._
> - _You may Ctrl-C the command in Terminal 2 and 3 once you're done._
> - _The command in Terminal 4 auto-stops by itself._

## Test Position Mode
To do a quick test of Position Mode, there is a fake position script that the user can run.
Idea is, this script will send Position commands (as a ROS topic), then the first motor should be expected to:
1. Rotate 360 degrees (clockwise) every 5 secs, 3 times
2. Stop for 5secs
3. Rotate 360 degrees (counter-clockwise) every 5 secs, 3 times
4. Stop for 5secs

To proceed with the test, execute these following commands on three (3) different terminals (in sequence):
> :memo: _Note: Assuming that the package was [built](#build) in Terminal 1._

| Terminal 2 | Terminal 3  | Terminal 4|
--- | --- | ---|
|<pre>`$ cd ~/ros2_ws/` <br>`$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash` <br>`$ source install/setup.bash` <br>`$ ros2 launch adi_tmc_coe_core 1slave_1axis.launch.py`  | <pre>`$ cd ~/ros2_ws/` <br>`$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash` <br>`$ source install/setup.bash` <br>`$ ros2 topic echo /tmc_info_1_0` | <pre>`$ cd ~/ros2_ws/src/adi_tmc_coe/adi_tmc_coe_core/scripts` <br>`$ sudo chmod 777 fake_cmd_pos.sh` <br>`$ ./fake_cmd_pos.sh` |

**Monitor the position of the first motor (watch out for position value at Terminal 3).**

> :memo: _Notes:_
> - _Terminals 3 and 4 are best viewed side-by-side._
> - _You may Ctrl-C the command in Terminal 2 and 3 once you're done._
> - _The command in Terminal 4 auto-stops by itself._

# Limitations
1. Current modules that are tested does not include Profile Torque Mode but still included on topic names for ease of implementation if decided to continue.
2. Homing Mode is not implemented.
3. Cyclic Synchronous Modes only accepts raw value (no conversions of unit) and is not the same with subscriber callbacks.
4. Host PC specifications play a crucial role to ensure low latency when exchanging data. 4 or more cores are recommended. Threads will increase depending on the number of devices/slaves and motors.
5. Due to having and allowing multiple threads (e.g. 1 thread for processdata cycle, 1 thread that executes SDOread/write), a ~0.01s delay was added in each SDOread/write retries to ensure proper processing.
